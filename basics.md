# Git Basics
* `git init` - creates a new git repository in the current folder
* `git status` - I can use this any time to see the current status of the repository
* `git add <file>` - places the file in the git staging area
* `git diff` - shows you the difference between the last revision and the newest version of that file
* `git commit` - commits the changes you have staged. Staging is like grocery shopping, you put the items (changes) in the cart. Commit is like checkout
* `git log` - show a history of the changes and commits you have made
* add one more line so there is something to show in git diff 
display reverse chronological order of comits
* `git push <remote> <branch>` - send changes tin local repository to a remote repository branch
* `git pull <remote> <branch> - get changes from remote repository into local repository
